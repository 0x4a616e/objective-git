# Objective Git - libgit2 wrapper for Objective-C
Objective Git provides Objective-C bindings to the libgit2 linkable C Git library.
It has been implemented as a framework right now. This is a good reference for
[setting up frameworks in xcode](http://atastypixel.com/blog/creating-applications-in-xcode-using-frameworks/).
This library follows the [rugged](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged) API as close
as possible while trying to maintain a native objective-c feel.

## Unit Testing
Unit testing in being done using [GHUnit](https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit).

## Todo
- Implement memory mgt and garbage collection finalizers
